## Lessons Learn

Over the course of building this project I have strengthen my understanding UIKit and its components.

**V0.1**

In this version specially I strengthen my knowledge using custom buttons and the UICollectionView. Also, I learn the importance of setting views programatically in a specific order. 

The orders is as follow:

    1. Instantiate the view class.
    2. Set `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints` attribute to false.
    3. Add the view object to the hierarchy.
    4. Add any constraints.
